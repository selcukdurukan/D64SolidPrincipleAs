    *
    *  The above code also follows the Liskov Substitution Principle,
    *  as the Product type can be substituted with both of its subtypes (Book and DVD) without breaking the program.
    *  At the same time, we have also implemented
    *  the Dependency Inversion Principle, as in the refactored code,
    *  high-level classes donâ€™t depend on low-level classes, either.
